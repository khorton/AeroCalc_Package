# vers     date      Notes
# 0.10   17 Mar 08   Initial version.
#
# 0.11   25 Apr 08   Added ssec module (mostly empty yet)
# 0.12   24 Nov 08   Added cd and cl modules.  Bug fixes in other modules.
# 0.13   30 Jun 09   * Python 3.0 compatibility.  
#                    * Added airspeed_p3k and val_input_p3k modules to address
#                      aspects that had no easy solution that was compatible 
#                      with both python 2.5 and python 3.0.
#                    * Removed "from __future__ import division" statements 
#                      from most files for python 3.0 compatibility (bug in
#                      python 3.0 causes doctest failures in presence of
#                      "from __future__ import division" statement).
#                   * Added some meat to SSEC module
#                   * Added interpolator module, with functions for linear
#                     interpolation in one, two or three dimensions
# 0.20   26 Feb 19  Python 3.7 compatibility tweaks

"""Various aeronautical engineering calculations

This package contains the following modules:

airspeed        - airspeed conversions and calculations.  Provides interactive
                  mode when run directly, e.g. 'python airspeed.py'
airspeed_p3k    - Python 3 compatible variant of airspeed module.
default_units   - defines default units to be used by all modules.  May be 
                  overridden by a user units file.
cd              - drag related calculations.
cl              - lift related calculations.
constants       - constants used by all modules.
interpolator    - linear interpolation in one, two or three dimensions
ssec            - static source error correction calculations.
std_atm         - standard atmosphere parametres and calculations.
unit_conversion - convert various aeronautical parametres between commonly
                  used units.
val_input       - validates user input when in interactive mode.
val_input_p3k   - Python 3 compatible variant of val_input module.
